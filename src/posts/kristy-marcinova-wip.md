## Who is you?

Hi! I'm Lydia. I'm a senior product designer on the design team here at Netlify.

I'm based in Berkeley, CA and I usually work 7am-3pm PST.

I'm an Aries ‚ôà and a [Type 7](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7) ("The Enthusiast") ‚Äì this is an oversimplification of my personality, but some of it rings true!

The good: I'm optimistic, enthusiastic, and game to start things and get others to join.

The not-so-good: Hate to say it, but follow-through can sometimes be a challenge üò¨ (because I get so excited about the start of things) ‚Äì I work to be aware and stay ahead of this, but please call me out if I have dropped a ball üèÄ

I'm on Pod A.

I previously worked on a growth team at Dropbox, for a couple startups in education and construction, and at Thoughtbot.

## What do you like to do and what are you best at doing?

Partnering with product to explore the "why" and the strategy behind things, to develop the concept.

Generating ideas (and leading design thinking sessions) with other designers and cross-functional peers.

Working with different disciplines ‚Äì product, data analysts, engineers, and more!

Working on things that are important to customers and good for the business.

Working with research and talking to customers.

I get energy from working on a variety of activities, with a split between heads-down and collaboration time.

Tinkering in Figma and learning new things from my design teammates.

Working with developers to bring designs to life (I used to do some front-end development!)

## What do you like to do but want to get better at doing?

I love illustration and would like to get better at it.

## What are you not as good at doing or not like doing as much?

Animation and complex prototyping ‚Äì but perhaps I should try to learn and get better!

Javascript, back-end dev, really any coding beyond html and css (halp)

I rely on data to make decisions, but doing quantitative analysis is not my strong suit ‚Äì I need to collaborate with the data team and product managers to identify insights.

## Any pet peeves?

Working on things that don't seem to be important to customers or the business.

"Overdocumenting" design beyond the developers' need (like redlining pixels if a component is already in the design system...I'm just like...why...)

## Anything else?

I enjoy being silly and lightening the mood ‚Äì please don‚Äôt mistake that for a lack of seriousness about work!

I can be self-deprecating, and I am game to change directions when it makes sense. Please don't mistake this flexibility for a lack of confidence/conviction in my designs!

I sometimes have not great posture and a skeptical looking face. I‚Äôm not bored, I swear!

I am open to feedback ‚Äì I‚Äôd love to know how what I‚Äôm doing is working or not working. Don‚Äôt hesitate to share with me anything positive or critical. I know we respect each other, so I welcome it!

I studied Art History and love art. I lived in Rome briefly and my happy place is probably a museum like this:

I have a dog named Enzo:
